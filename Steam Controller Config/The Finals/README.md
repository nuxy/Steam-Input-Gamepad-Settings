Alternative to [Embark Studios](https://www.embark-studios.com) Official layout for THE FINALS - Gamepad With Camera Controls.  This template provides keyboard mapping that _loosely mimics_ the [Steam Controller](https://store.steampowered.com/app/353370/Steam_Controller) behavior.

## Notable differences from HPC layouts

For the mostpart, the game is playable but there are noticeable differences between the game HPC integration and using a WASD layout.  I have listed the ones I noticed while playing below.

### No controller AIM assist

This feature is currently not supported when using K & M bindings.  However, based on past experience I don't see much difference during game play.

### Multipurpose buttons usage

The game currently handles controller button bindings that serve multiple purposes.  Buttons may perform different operations based on the context (e.g. in-game action vs menu operations).

In this layout these operations are implemented as separate controller bindings.

### Incorrect glyphs in game UI

The game interface shows K & M buttons that do not correspond to the controller.
